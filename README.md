## Architecture Overview

Pixel Positions is built using Laravel's MVC structure:
- **Controllers** manage business logic (e.g., `JobController`, `TagController`, `RegisteredUserController`).
- **Models** represent domain entities: `Job`, `User`, `Employer`, `Tag`.
- **Blade Components** deliver a modular, reusable frontend (e.g., Job Card, Tag, Layout).
- **Routes** are defined in `routes/web.php` for clean separation of concerns.
- Uses Laravel's authentication scaffolding for secure user flows.
- Database migrations and seeders ensure consistent schema and development data.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** PHP 8+, Laravel Framework
- **Frontend:** Blade, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Database:** SQLite (can be replaced with PostgreSQL or MySQL)
- **Storage:** Local filesystem or Amazon S3 (configurable)
- **Testing:** Pest
- **Other:** Composer, PNPM, Laravel Eloquent ORM

## S3 & Storage Configuration

Pixel Positions supports both local storage and Amazon S3 for file uploads (such as company logos). You can switch between these options by configuring your `.env` file.

### Using Local Storage (Recommended for Local Development)

1. In your `.env`, set:
   ```
   FILESYSTEM_DISK=public
   ```
2. Run the following command to create a symbolic link for storage access:
   ```bash
   php artisan storage:link
   ```
3. Uploaded files will be stored in `storage/app/public` and served via `/storage`.

### Using Amazon S3 (For Production or S3-backed Local Development)

1. In your `.env`, set:
   ```
   FILESYSTEM_DISK=s3
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
   AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=your-aws-region
   AWS_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
   ```
2. Make sure your AWS IAM user has permission to put/get objects in your specified bucket.
3. No need to run `php artisan storage:link` for S3 usage.

**Switching storage backends is as simple as changing the `FILESYSTEM_DISK` value and providing the relevant credentials.**

---

## Usage

- **Register** as a new user (employer) and upload your company logo.
- **Create a Job:** Fill in job details, salary, location, schedule, and up to 3 tags.
- **Browse Jobs:** The home page lists featured and recent jobs. Use the search bar and tags to filter.
- **Job Details:** Click on any job to view more information or apply via the external URL.

---

## Testing

Pixel Positions uses Pest and PHPUnit for automated testing.

To run the tests:

```bash
php artisan test
# or
vendor/bin/pest
```

---

## Production & Deployment Recommendations

- **Environment Variables:** Never commit `.env` to version control. Configure production secrets securely.
- **Caching:** Enable config, route, and view caching for performance:
  ```bash
  php artisan config:cache
  php artisan route:cache
  php artisan view:cache
  ```
- **Database:** Use managed MySQL/PostgreSQL with regular backups.
- **Queue & Email:** Configure a robust queue driver (e.g., Redis) and mail service (SES, Postmark, Mailgun).
- **Logging:** Use daily or remote logging, monitor logs for errors.
- **Storage:** Use S3-compatible storage for logos in production.
- **HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS and set `APP_URL` accordingly.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly audit dependencies (`composer audit`, `npm audit`).
- **Rate Limiting/Abuse Protection:** Consider Laravelâ€™s built-in rate limiters and security middleware.

## Potential Improvements

- **Job Expiration:** Auto-remove or hide expired jobs.
- **Advanced Search:** Filter by location, salary range, schedule type.
- **User Roles:** Separate employer and job seeker roles, with tailored dashboards.
- **Job Application Tracking:** Allow users to apply directly and track applications.
- **Notifications:** Email or Slack notifications for new jobs or applications.
- **Admin Panel:** For moderation and analytics.
- **API Support:** Expose a REST API for jobs, tags, and employers.
- **CI/CD:** Integrate automated tests and deployment pipelines.
- **Accessibility:** Further enhance accessibility and ARIA compliance.
- **Localization:** Support for multiple languages.
- **Performance:** Optimize database queries and frontend assets.
- **Production Hardening:** Implement proper security headers, CSRF/XSS protections, and audit policies.
